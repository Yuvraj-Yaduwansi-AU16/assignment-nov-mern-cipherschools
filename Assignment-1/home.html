               <li> Initially, he seems to have a soft spot for children as seen in the film when he tries to make a child on the bus laugh, when he entertains at the children's hospital and is seemingly very happy to be doing so, when he tries to make young Bruce smile and when he spares Alfred because Bruce was watching. </li> <br>
               <li> Later on, he develops a trait to kill people who wrong him- from the three Wallstreet men on the subway, his abusive mother, his former co-worker, Randall, who set him up twice in the film, to television show host Murray Franklin, Arthur's former father figure who he kills on camera after being invited and humiliated on Franklin's nighttime talk show. </li> <br> </ol>

         <p id="Personal_Summary_text"> <br>Born in Gotham City on November 21, 1946, Arthur was abandoned as a baby and later adopted by a young woman named Penny Fleck, who went on to raise him very poorly. She had allowed her then violent boyfriend to abuse both her adopted child and herself. Arthur was found tied to a radiator, bruised and malnourished from the abuse, and he suffered severe head trauma that was believed to have given him his laughing disorder. His disorder caused him to laugh involuntarily at inappropriate times, heightening particularly when he was tensed. He was a very lonely individual whose only company was his mother, but he longed for a romantic relationship- something he was unable to form due to his mental illness.</p>
